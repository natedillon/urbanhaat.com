		&quot;Even though there still is a lot to come, I'm beginning to reflect on my past two months here, 
		as this is the last big leg of my journey. I thought I knew alot about the situation of crafts 
		and artisans in India, but I have learned so much more this trip! In India, all things handmade 
		are generally looked at as less valuable than things machine made. This is for many reasons, 
		like because artisan labor is so cheap and because of the outside, western, influences that make 
		people desire the new, plasticy inventions of the moment. Because of these changes in trends and 
		desires, many artforms and handicrafts techniques are now extinct, with many more on the 
		endangered list. I didnt realise before that once a certain technique is gone, it's gone. 
		Even with attempts to revive certain techniques, they are never brought back with as much glory 
		and beauty as in the beginning. However, its been really encouraging the people I have met who 
		are interested in uplifting artisans, revaluing what they produce, and keeping art and culture 
		alive in India.
	</p>
	<p>
		&quot;It was these types of people who inspired me to try and do my small part to help artisans in India, 
		if not mainly for the selfish reason that these things are beautiful and I want myself and others 
		to be able to enjoy them! So out of that is where Urban Haat was created. When I get back I am 
		starting with a sample sale of sorts, and hoping that people back home will be as excited about 
		everything I've found here as I am! To give a little preview, I have collected many scarves and 
		shawls, jewelry, purses and bags, household textiles, paper products, brass items... The techniques 
		used on these items are like none I've ever seen, detailed kantha stitch from west Bengal, woven 
		grass table runners from Kerala, block printed scarves from Rajasthan! The date I picked for my 
		Urban Haat sale is December 10th and 11th. I would love for everyone to stop by and say hi, see and 
		learn about these amazing things I'm talking about, and maybe even finish your holiday shopping!&quot;
